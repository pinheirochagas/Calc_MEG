function s = kingsize(x,dim)%KINGSIZE Size of a 3-D matrix%% Gives a vector of 3 sizes. The function SIZE gives% for a matrix% X = [1 0%      0 1]% as a size [2 2]. However, when A was acually meant to be% a 3-D matrix you would rather have the result [2 2 1]% This is done with KINGSIZE.%% See also SIZE.s = [size(x,1) size(x,2) size(x,3)];if nargin == 2, s = s(dim); end
